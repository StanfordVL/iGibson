    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide **Environments** that follow the [OpenAI gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) interface for applications such as reinforcement learning algorithms. Generally speaking, an **Environment** instantiates **Scene**, **Object** and **Robot** and import them into its **Simulator**. An **Environment** also instantiates a list of **Sensors** (usually as part of the observation space) and a **Task**, which further includes a list of **Reward Functions** and **Termination Conditions**.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Sensors\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide different types of sensors as lightweight wrappers around the renderer. Currently we support RGB, surface normal, segmentation, 3D point cloud, depth map, optical flow, and scene flow, and also 1-beam and 16-beam LiDAR signals. Additionally, we provide a sensor noise model with random dropout (currently only for depth map and 1-beam LiDAR) to simulate real-world sensor noise. The amount of noise can be controlled by `depth_noise_rate` and `scan_noise_rate` in the config files. Contribution of more noise models is most welcome.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each **Task** should implement `reset_scene`, `reset_agent`, `step` and `get_task_obs`.\n",

    "- `step` will be called during `env.step` and should include task-specific details of what needs to be done at every timestep. \n",
    "- `get_task_obs` returns task-specific observation (non-sensory observation) as a numpy array. For instance, typical goal-oriented robotics tasks should include goal information and proprioceptive states in `get_task_obs`.\n",

    "To instantiate an **Environment**, we first need to create a YAML config file. It will specify parameters for the **Environment** (e.g. robot type, action frequency, etc), the **Sensors** (e.g. sensor types, image resolution, noise rate, etc), the **Task** (e.g. task type, goal distance range, etc), the **Reward Functions** (e.g. reward types, reward scale, etc) and the **Termination Conditions** (e.g. goal convergence threshold, time limit, etc).
